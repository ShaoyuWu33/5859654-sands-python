# signals and systems Python project
# 1. Project Description
This README file contains a Python-based signal processing project designed to demonstrate signal generation, such as time-shifting, time-scaling, etc, signal transformations, and visualization using Python. The project follows modular software design principles, uses version control (Git), and includes documentation to ensure reproducibility and readability. It aligns with the requirements for the "Signals and Systems" (S&S) course, with support for mid-term (core functionality) and final (testing, packaging) submissions.
